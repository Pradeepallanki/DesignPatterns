The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern. Simply put, the pattern intends to encapsulate in an object all the data required for performing a given action (command), including what method to call, the method's arguments, and the object to which the method belongs.

Generally I have used command pattern to reduce cyclometric complexity (i.e,, Many if else statements).
