Observer is a behavioral design pattern. It specifies communication between objects: observable and observers. An observable is an object which notifies observers about the changes in its state.

For example, a youtuber has subscribers, whenever youtuber uploads any video, subscribers must be notified. Here youtuber is a observable and subscribers are observers.
